        <h1>ListBoy</h1>
        <p>ListBoy is a tool for making lists of lists of lists ...</p>
        <p>They are easily and quickly defined using JSON, and ListBoy renders them for you.</p>
        <h2>How to use</h2>
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You'll need to include the javascript source. I wrote it in TypeScript, but
                AFAIK Chrome doesn't support <span class="code">.ts</span> files out of
                the box.
            </li>
            <li>
                You'll need to define your structured content somewhere (I personally like a
                <span class="code">script</span> tag in the <span class="code">head</span>).
            </li>
            <li>
                You'll also need to mark a place that you want ListBoy to put your rendered
                content.
            </li>
            <li>And to tie it all together, a call to ListBoy.</li>
        </ol>
        <textarea>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- #1 include the ListBoy Code-->
        <script src="https://github.mckaysalisbury.com/ListBoy/ListBoy.js"></script>
        <script>
            // #2 Declare the structure
            let myContent = { a: "b", c: ["d", "e"], f: null }

            // #4 Call to ListBoy
            ListBoy.RenderTo(myContent, "ListBoyPleasePutMyStuffHere");
        </script>
        </head>
    <body>
        <!-- #3 Mark where the content should go -->
        <div id="ListBoyPleasePutMyStuffHere"></div>
    </body>
</html></textarea>
        <p>Will look something like this:</p>

        <div id="ListBoyPleasePutMyStuffHere"></div>

        <p>
            Admittedly, this isn't pretty, and looks chaotic, on the page as is, but the structure
            emitted is rich, and there are a lot of different CSS classes that are emitted so that
            you can easily make it look more organized.
        </p>

        <div id="lines"></div>

        <h3>Reference Sample</h3>

        <p>
            While you could read the rest of this document to figure out how to use ListBoy in more
            detail, there's a chance that I forgot to update the docs, or something. I built ListBoy
            to make my Klingon reference cheat sheet. I think it's a pretty good example of what
            ListBoy can do.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Easy JSON notation.</strong> Basic JSON support just works, Objects (which
                ListBoy emits as Dictionaries), Arrays, strings, and numbers should just work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Programmattic CSS Class list.</strong> There's a
                <span class="code">CSSClasses</span> enum that enumerates all CSS classes that
                ListBoy emits.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pseudo-markdown support.</strong> Beginning any string with a backquote
                <span class="code">`</span>, tells ListBoy to ignore default CSS Classes, and enter
                it's pseudo-markdown mode. Currently it only supports <span class="code">*em*</span>
                and <span class="code">**strong**</span>, but I could add more.<br/>
                "<span class="code">`<span id="markdown-sample"></span></span>" becomes
                "<span id="markdown-rendered" class="code"></span>"
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>TODO</h2>
        <p>
            See the <a href="https://github.com/mckaysalisbury/ListBoy/projects/1">Kanban board</a>
            for things I still want to do. I think Github allows you to file bugs or feature
            requests if there's something you want out of ListBoy.</p>
